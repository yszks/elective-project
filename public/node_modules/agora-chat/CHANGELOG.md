# Changes to Agora chat

## v1.3.1

v1.3.1 was released on Dec 20, 2024.

#### Improvements

-   Added the support for pinning messages in one-to-one conversations. Users can call `pinMessage` or `unpinMessage` to pin or unpin a one-to-one chat message.
-   Added the `ConnectionParameters#isFixedDeviceId` parameter (`true` by default) to specify whether to use a fixed device ID (deviceId). Specifically, the SDK generates a device ID for a browser and saves it to the local storage. Then in the browser, all SDK instances use the same device. In previous versions, a random device ID is used for connections of each SDK instance. In this case, each SDK instance uses a different device for connections.
-   Added the callback for DNS request failures.
-   Added the reason for requesting to join the group to the `requestToJoin` event that is received by the group owner and administrators that approved the join request.
